I need you to do more validation of the free-text description with this rules:

- Description cannot contain personal information.
- Sometimes, phone numbers are hidden in the description as text (e.g., 'Kosong Delapan Satu Tiga' with the number
   spelled out). This is not allowed, and you should return an error if you find it.

title: Use your judgement for a suitable short one-line summary for this listing.

propertyType: Use enum for property types: house, apartment, warehouse, etc.

listingType: Use enum for listing types: sale, rent.

address:
- In Indonesian, exact address often represented in street name + street number + house number.
- The input pattern is {Jl/Jalan/Jln} {street name} {street number} {house number} [RT number RW number] [City].
- Examples of exact address:
  - Jln. Agung Barat 5 no. 8
  - Jl. Sulaiman no. 11 RT 10 RW 15
  - Jalan Wicaksono no. 12 RT 10, Surabaya
- Examples of non-exact address:
  - Jl. Wiyung Surabaya Barat (not exact because there is no house number)
  - Jalan Sulaiman VI (not exact because there is no house number, only street number)
- Note a common mistake is that 'nol jalan' is a specific term in Indonesian listing text, this does not indicate the
  number of the street or house.
- Please check if the address is correct.

price: In Indonesian numerical notation, \"M\" indeed represents \"Milyar,\" which is equivalent to \"billion\" in
    English.
    Sometimes the value is in decimal format.
    The input pattern is "{number} {notation}"
    Examples:
    - 5 Milyar or 5 Miliar or 5M is 5000000000
    - 1.7 M or 1,7 M is 1700000000
    - 1.27 M or 1,27 M is 1270000000
    - 2 Triliun or 2T is 2000000000000
    - 2.3 Triliun or 2.3T is 2300000000000
    - 2 Juta or 2JT is 2000000
    - 40.3 Juta or 40.3JT is 40300000
    Please pay attention to the price format especialy: 1.7 M or 1,7 M is not 1.7 but 1700000000
    Remember that in Indonesian locale, sometimes comma is used for decimal point, e.g. 1,050 Milyar is 1.05 billion and
    not 1050 billion
