        In Indonesian numerical notation, \"M\" indeed represents \"Milyar,\" which is equivalent to \"billion\" in English.
        Sometimes the value is in decimal format.
        The input pattern is "{number} {notation}"
        Examples:
        - 5 Milyar or 5 Miliar or 5M is 5000000000
        - 1.7 M or 1,7 M is 1700000000
        - 1.27 M or 1,27 M is 1270000000
        - 2 Triliun or 2T is 2000000000000
        - 2.3 Triliun or 2.3T is 2300000000000
        - 2 Juta or 2JT is 2000000
        Please pay attention to the price format especialy: 1.7 M or 1,7 M is not 1.7 but 1700000000
