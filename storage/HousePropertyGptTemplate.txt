            In Indonesian, exact address often represented in street name + street number + house number.
            The input pattern is "{Jl/Jalan/Jln} {street name} {street number} {house number} [RT number RW number] [City]"

            Examples of exact address:
            - Jln. Agung Barat 5 no. 8
            - Jl. Sulaiman no. 11 RT 10 RW 15
            - Jalan Wicaksono no. 12 RT 10, Surabaya

            Examples of non-exact address:
            - Jl. Wiyung Surabaya Barat (not exact because there is no house number)
            - Jalan Sulaiman VI (not exact because there is no house number, only street number)

            If no street name with exact house number is present or only street name exist, it's safer to assume that the ad does not contain an address so leave this field empty string.
            If there is a hint that the address is approximate (containing "Dekat", "Sekitar") in front of the street name, assume that this is not exact address and leave this field empty string.

            In Indonesian numerical notation, \"M\" indeed represents \"Milyar,\" which is equivalent to \"billion\" in English.

            Examples:
            - 5 Milyar or 5 Miliar or 5M is 5000000000
            - 1.7 M or 1,7 M is 1700000000

            - 40.3 Juta or 40.3JT is 40300000
            Please pay attention to the price format especialy: 1.7 M or 1,7 M is not 1.7 but 1700000000
            Remember that in Indonesian locale, sometimes comma is used for decimal point, e.g. 1,050 Milyar is 1.05 billion and not 1050 billion
